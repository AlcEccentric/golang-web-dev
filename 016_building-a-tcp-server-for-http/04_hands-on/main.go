// I don't finish this work for the following reasons:
// First, when handling get, just write different response function to different routes
// the logic is similar like last hands-on
// Second, I do not know how to triger a POST request with html
// Third, although I can refer to solution for the way to triger a POST,
// According what I have leared about tcp, we can not get the body of http message easily
// since the lenth of http header is variable
// In order to handle post, we need some advanced api to parse http message and get the body
